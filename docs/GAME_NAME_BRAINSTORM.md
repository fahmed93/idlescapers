## Conclusion

The current name **IdleScapers** is serviceable but has room for improvement, particularly regarding SEO competitiveness and potential legal concerns with the "Scape" suffix. 

**SkillForge Idle** emerges as the strongest alternative, offering significant improvements in brand identity, search engine optimization, and market differentiation while maintaining clear genre communication.

However, if the project has already built some recognition under IdleScapers, the cost of rebranding may outweigh the benefits. In that case, focusing development resources on game quality and marketing would be more valuable than a name change.

For a project in early development with no established brand recognition, **SkillForge Idle** is the recommended path forward.
